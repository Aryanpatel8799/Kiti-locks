├── users.ts          # User management endpoints
├── inventory.ts      # Inventory management endpoints
└── analytics.ts      # Enhanced analytics endpoints
```

### New Frontend Files:
```
client/components/admin/
├── DashboardComponents.tsx    # Reusable dashboard components
├── UserManagement.tsx         # User management interface
└── InventoryManagement.tsx    # Inventory management interface
```

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Admin Features
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Use the new tabbed interface to access different admin functions

### Dashboard
- View real-time statistics
- Monitor inventory alerts
- Use quick actions for common tasks

### Inventory Management
- Monitor all products and stock levels
- Set custom low stock thresholds
- Perform bulk stock updates
- View sales analytics and trends

### User Management

- View detailed user profiles
- Manage user roles and status
- Analyze user behavior and trends

## API Testing

You can test the new APIs using curl or any API testing tool:

```bash
# Get inventory overview
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8082/api/inventory/overview

# Get low stock alerts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8082/api/inventory/alerts/low-stock?threshold=10

# Get all users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8082/api/users

# Update product stock
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId":"PRODUCT_ID","quantity":50,"reason":"restock"}' \
  http://localhost:8082/api/inventory/stock/update
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination to handle large datasets
- **Caching**: Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
- **Indexing**: Proper database indexing for search operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data as needed

## Future Enhancements

Phase 2 provides a solid foundation for future improvements:
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting and charts
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export capabilities
- **Automated Reordering**: Integration with suppliers for automatic reorders
- **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile admin app
- **Multi-store Support**: Support for multiple store locations

## Browser Compatibility

The admin interface is optimized for modern browsers:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **403 Access Denied**: Ensure user has admin role
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MongoDB connection
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run type-check`
4. **API Errors**: Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Development:
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Check types
npm run type-check

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Conclusion

Phase 2 significantly enhances the admin capabilities of the Kiti Store e-commerce platform, providing powerful tools for inventory management, user administration, and business analytics. The modular architecture ensures easy maintenance and future extensibility.
