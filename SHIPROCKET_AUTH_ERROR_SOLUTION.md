## 🚨 Current Issues Identified

1. **403 Forbidden Error**: Shiprocket API returning permission denied
2. **Rate Limiting**: Too many authentication attempts
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: SHIPROCKET_EMAIL and SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD not configured
4. **Account Permissions**: Shiprocket account may not have API access enabled

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Improved 403 error detection and messaging
- ✅ Better rate limiting with exponential backoff
- ✅ Development mode fallbacks

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
- ✅ Created `env.example` file with all required variables

### 3. Rate Limiting Improvements
- ✅ Exponential backoff (1min → 2min → 4min → 5min max)
- ✅ Consecutive failure tracking
- ✅ Automatic retry with fresh tokens
- ✅ Development mode bypass for testing

## 🔧 Steps to Fix the Error

### Step 1: Create Environment File
```bash

2. **Check Account Status**: Ensure your account is fully activated
3. **Verify API Access**: Contact Shiprocket support if needed

### Step 4: Test the Integration
```bash
# Restart your server
npm run dev

# Check the logs for authentication status
```

## 🛠️ Development Mode Features
